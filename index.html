      <p class="main-content__description">Berkshire reported earnings of $26.4 billion in the second quarter, a turnaround from its $49.7 billion loss in the first quarter, when the pandemic caused a plunge in the stock market.</p>
      <p class="main-content__article">The strong recovery in the stock market — and a surge in the value of Apple’s stock, in particular — drove a rebound in profits for Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in the second quarter. Berkshire on Saturday said it earned $26.4 billion in the second quarter, a turnaround from a $49.7 billion loss in the first quarter, when a plunge in the stock market, prompted by the coronavirus outbreak, caused huge paper losses in Mr. Buffett’s giant stock portfolio. In the second quarter of last year, Berkshire earned $14.2 billion. The weak economy, caused by the pandemic and business interruptions, weighed on many of the companies that the conglomerate owns. Berkshire warned that the pandemic could lead to changes in the economy that could hurt its operations. “We cannot reliably predict when business activities at our numerous and diverse operations will normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve,” it said in its second-quarter filing. Aside from its stock holdings in companies like Apple and Bank of America, Berkshire owns outright a wide array of large businesses — in the insurance, railway, energy, retail and manufacturing sectors — that provide a snapshot of the health of the American economy.</p>
